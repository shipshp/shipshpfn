Introduction

Ship-Shape-File-Navigator (Ship) is a standalone FLOSS navigational file manager focused to ease the management of Shapefile files, a de-facto standard format to handle GIS data.

Ship allows you navigate through directories and see shapefile's (and some other geographic formats as well) main characteristics, tabular data, and a preview of their geometries.

With Ship you'll be able to do common file operations like copy, move, rename and delete to the shapefiles as a whole (and soon also apply batch geoprocessing to them).
