Intro
=====

Ship-Shape-File-Navigator (Ship) is a standalone FLOSS navigational file manager focused to ease the management of Shapefile files, a de-facto standard format to handle GIS data.

Ship allows you navigate through directories and see shapefile's (and some other geographic formats as well) main characteristics, tabular data, and a preview of their geometries.

With Ship you'll be able to do common file operations like copy, move, rename and delete to the shapefiles as a whole (and soon also apply batch geoprocessing to them).

Installing
==========

Ship-Shape-File-Navigator only requires Python 2.7 with Tkinter so it doesn't require installation but having those in your system.

Windows users only require a Python 2.7 interpreter.
Linux users should have Python already installed but may have to install 'python-tk' package (apt-get intall python-tk, yum...).

Extract Ship to some place in your system and run the shipshpfn/gui.py file,

from the Ship folder:
python shipshpfn/gui.py

or another path:
python [path_to_Ship]/shipshpfn/gui.py
